text = """Anne Longfield, the Children’s Commissioner for England, has published research looking at 
the number of children who leave the education system at 18 without reaching Level 2 attainment 
(five GCSEs grade A* to C, or equivalent technical qualifications). These are children who will 
have spent 14 years in compulsory education, often having more than £100,000 of public money spent 
on their education, and yet are leaving the education system without basic benchmark qualifications. 
This hampers their chances of finding apprenticeships or good jobs.

The Children’s Commissioner’s analysis reveals that in 2018, 98,799 children in England 
(18% of all school leavers) left education at 18 without substantive qualifications 
(reaching Level 2 attainment). This rate is now rising after it fell continuously between 2005 and 2015. 
The Commissioner’s research shows this rise is being driven by a sharp increase in the proportion 
of pupils receiving Free School Meals (FSM) failing to achieve these targets. Since 2015, 
the number of children receiving FSM who have left education without proper qualifications 
has increased to 28,225 – up from 28% to 37% of all education leavers in England. Finish. """
