# print Python's built-in punctuation string
print('\n',string.punctuation ,'\n')


# MY SOLUTION

# loop through words
#     for each character in word
#         if character in list_of_punctuation
#             remove character

#  CHAT GPT SOLUTION
# loop through each word in words
#     create an empty string cleaned_word
#     loop through each character in word
#         if character is not in list_of_punctuation
#             add character to cleaned_word
#     replace original word with cleaned_word

# CHAT GPT ACTUAL CODE
# now handled inside compute_readability; no need for duplicate loop
