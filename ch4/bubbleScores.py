# CHAT GPT NOTES BELOW ON DIFFERENCE OF WHILE AND FOR .. IN LOOP
# üîπ Why the for loop is better in this case:

# No manual index management

# In the while loop, you have to initialise i = 0 before the loop, and then remember to increment it with i = i + 1 inside the loop.

# If you forget to increment, you get an infinite loop.

# The for i in range(length): version automatically takes care of index progression.

# ‚úÖ Less chance of mistakes.
# ‚úÖ Cleaner and shorter code.

# Clearer intent

# for i in range(length): immediately tells the reader:
# ‚ÄúLoop from 0 up to length - 1‚Äù.

# With while, you have to read multiple lines (i = 0, condition, increment) to figure out the loop‚Äôs purpose.

# ‚úÖ More readable and Pythonic.

# No need to touch i yourself

# In the while version, you mistakenly still have i = i + 1 inside your for loop ‚Äî but it does nothing because the for loop ignores your manual increment.

# With for, you let Python manage i so you don‚Äôt risk breaking the loop logic.

# üîπ When a while loop is better

# Use a while loop when:

# You don‚Äôt know in advance how many times you need to loop.
# (e.g., keep looping until the user types "quit", or until a sensor gives a certain reading).

# Use a for loop when:

# You do know the number of iterations (like looping through a list, or range(n)).

# üëâ In this exact case (looping through all the scores by index), the for loop is more Pythonic, safer, and simpler.
